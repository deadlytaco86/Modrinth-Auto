# Modrinth-Auto
Download Minecraft Java mods automatically!__
__
This program allows you to select minecraft java mods you want to download from a (for now) pre defined checklist. These mods will then be downloaded with just a push of a button. The mods will be for your chosen version and platform. The program will also tell you if it has found a download for the version and platform.__
__
When you press the download button, the savefile will be updated. The next time you open the program, you can immediately load the previously used settings instead of checking the boxes all over again. The savefile is located in ...\Documents\Modrinth Auto\.

# future plans
Future versions will allow you to search modrinth from within the program and add additional mods to a "my mods" section"

# how to run

install the libraries at the top, then run the program how you want to. Just keep in mind the location of the base_links.json file.__
